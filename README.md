# Simple MVC Framework

This is a very small framework based on Brad Traversy's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Zcs3@glIxZUWZNdpB_oEkbhKFBV0iCzgCXKdE92_ch-T4V9gNxQtNKDGq1_mkAXpoAvq2/)

and creating it mainly for studiyng purpose. It is based on MVC pattern and it is suitable for fast creating small projects, trying different ideas, conceptions etc..

I had updated slightly this version from the original of the Brad from his course. I added also some stuffs like

composer, facebook and google login buttons, different helper functions in helpers folder, user's settings page where you can change your profile photo, reset the password, change the password or to delete permamently your account. Refactored a little the registration and login logic. Updated the main views adding more icons.
