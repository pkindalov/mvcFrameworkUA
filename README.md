# Simple MVC Framework

This is a very small framework based on Brad Traversy's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Zcs3@glIxZUWZNdpB_oEkbhKFBV0iCzgCXKdE92_ch-T4V9gNxQtNKDGq1_mkAXpoAvq2/)

and creating it mainly for tutorial purpose. It is based on MVC pattern and it is suitable for fast creating small projects.

I had updated slightly this version from the original of the Brad from his course. I added also some stuffs like

composer, facebook and google login buttons, different helper functions in helpers folder. Refactored a little

the registration and login logic. Updated the main views adding more icons.


Work still in progress...
